# Census 2011 Dataset Analysis
# Introduction
- Census is nothing but a process of collecting, compiling, analyzing, evaluating, publishing and disseminating statistical data regarding the population.
- It is a reflection of truth and facts as they exist in a country about its people, their diversity of habitation, religion, culture, language, education, health and socio-economic status.
- The word ‘Census’ is derived from the Latin word ‘Censere’ meaning ‘to assess or to rate’.
- It covers demographic, social and economic data and are provided as of a particular date. Census is useful for formulation of development policies and plans and demarcating constituencies for elections.
- The Census of India has been conducted 15 times, As of 2011. It has been conducted every 10 years, beginning in 1871.
- In this project I tried to analyse Census report of 2011 of India through MS SQL Server and made a dashboard and few charts to visualise it using Tableau.
- In this Project I used the data from official source so I didn't find any discrepencies in it and therefore started directly to analyse the data.
- This dataset mainly include the data about the sex ratio, population growth, literacy rate, total popualtion, etc. of each district of India.
