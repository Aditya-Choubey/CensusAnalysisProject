# Census 2011 Dataset Analysis
- In this project I tried to analyse Census report of 2011 of India through MS SQL Server and made a dashboard and few charts to visualise it using Tableau.
- In this Project I used the data from official source so I didn't find any discrepencies in it and therefore started directly to analyse the data.
- This dataset mainly include the data about the sex ratio, population growth, literacy rate, total popualtion, etc. of each district of India.  
- Here is the link of tableau dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.choubey1086/viz/Census2011AnalysisVisualization/Dashboard1?publish=yes
